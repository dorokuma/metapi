# Metapi Engineering Rules

These rules apply to the whole repository unless a deeper `AGENTS.md` overrides
them. They are intentionally opinionated and mechanical so humans and agents can
make small, consistent changes without re-learning the codebase each time.

## Core Rules / 核心铁律

- **构建与测试**：全量构建执行 `npm run build`（包含 Web/Server/Desktop 构建）；测试执行 `npm test`（Vitest 单元与集成测试）。
- **静态与契约检查**：类型检查执行 `npm run typecheck`；架构与仓库漂移检查执行 `npm run repo:drift-check`；数据库契约与兼容性检查执行 `npm run test:schema:unit` / `npm run test:schema:parity` / `npm run test:schema:upgrade`。
- **提交规范**：提交规范——commit message 须过全局 commit-msg hook：Conventional Commits 类型白名单、≤72 字、冒号后一空格、禁噪声词与密钥。
- **决策与踩坑记录**：决策/踩坑须记 .agents/notes/（满足触发规则任一条即写，参考模板并按规范归档）。

## Golden Principles

- Prefer one source of truth. If a helper, contract, or workflow already owns
  an invariant, extend it instead of creating a parallel implementation.
- Fix the family, not just the symptom. When a bug comes from a repeated
  pattern, sweep adjacent paths in the same subsystem before calling the work
  done.
- Keep changes narrow and reviewable. Land one coherent slice at a time and
  avoid bundling unrelated cleanup into the same patch.

## Server Layers

- `src/server/routes/**` are adapters, not owners. Route files may register
  Fastify endpoints, parse request context, and delegate. They must not own
  protocol conversion, retry policy, stream lifecycle, billing, or
  persistence.
- If a helper is imported by anything outside one route file, it does not
  belong under `src/server/routes/proxy/`.
- `src/server/proxy-core/**` owns proxy orchestration. Endpoint fallback should
  flow through `executeEndpointFlow()`. Channel/session bookkeeping should flow
  through `sharedSurface.ts`.
- `src/server/transformers/**` are protocol-pure. Do not import from
  `src/server/routes/**`, Fastify, OAuth services, token router, or runtime
  dispatch modules. If a transformer needs a shared contract, move it to a
  neutral module first.
- Whole-body upstream reads in proxy orchestration should use
  `readRuntimeResponseText()` instead of direct `.text()` reads.

## Platform And Routing Rules

- Platform behavior must be explicit. Detection, endpoint preference, discovery
  transport, and management capability should come from one declared capability
  story, not scattered `if platform === ...` branches.
- Thin adapters must stay honest. Do not let a platform look feature-complete
  through inherited defaults if the underlying upstream does not support the
  feature.
- Retry classification and routing health classification should share the same
  failure vocabulary whenever possible.

## Database Rules

- One schema change requires three synchronized outputs: update the Drizzle
  schema, update SQLite migration history, and regenerate checked-in schema
  artifacts together.
- Cross-dialect bootstrap and upgrade SQL must be generated from the schema
  contract. Do not hand-write new MySQL/Postgres schema patches in feature
  code.
- Legacy schema compatibility is temporary and spec-owned. Additive startup
  shims should stay narrow and trace back to a feature compatibility spec.

## Web Rules

- Pages are orchestration surfaces, not shared utility libraries. Do not import
  one top-level page from another top-level page.
- Mobile behavior should reuse existing shared primitives first:
  `ResponsiveFilterPanel`, `ResponsiveBatchActionBar`, `MobileCard`,
  `useIsMobile`, and `mobileLayout.ts`.
- When a page grows a second complex modal, drawer, or panel family, extract it
  into a domain subfolder before adding more inline state and rendering logic.

## Guardrails

- Run `npm run repo:drift-check` before finishing changes that touch shared
  architecture boundaries.
- If you add a new boundary-heavy module, add or extend an architecture test in
  the same area so the rule becomes executable.
- Keep local planning files under `docs/plans/`. They are intentionally ignored
  by git and should not be treated as published documentation.
